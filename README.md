## TODO

- check if other encounters are possible (piranha plant, tanks, hands)
    - their animation is most likely not right (it's hardcoded for hammer brothers)
- make player go back to last level when losing
- inventory
    - twister warp
- object spawning when user-defined conditions are met (very low priority, sorry)
    - airship animation
- castle full-screen flash animation (also low priority)
- figure out invisible warps and their interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through inv. warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world
- boat (an object that simply follows you until you go on specific tiles)
- warps with levels (useful for real pipes, important for tower)

## notes

### objects

755 - level beaten animation
756 - castle beaten animation
757 - encounter beaten smoke animation
758 - scenery show/hide smoke
