## TODO

- inventory
    - twister warp
- object spawning when user-defined conditions are met
    - airship animation
- castle full-screen flash animation (low priority)
- figure out invisible warps and their interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through inv. warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world
- no smoke sceneries disappear weirdly
- boat shenanigans
