## TODO

- add more characters in fonts
    - check out that n char in world 9 text

    - airship animation

### low priority

- flashing effect for whistle warps and castles
- think about isClimbing and isWater properties
- join the yoshi gfx together
- implements encounters's movesWhen function
- figure out warps interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world
- anchor item
- star item
- think about changesStateWhen setting in world 3 conditional bridges
