## TODO

- check if other encounters are possible (piranha plant, tanks, hands)
    - their animation is most likely not right (it's hardcoded for hammer brothers)
- inventory
    - twister warp
- object spawning when user-defined conditions are met
    - airship animation
- castle full-screen flash animation (low priority)
- figure out invisible warps and their interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through inv. warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world

- bug with lastmovement and warps (use the warps in world 3)
    - same stuff with encounters?
    - seems to be fixed now???
- fix stuff with saved levels
    - save levels only on win, not on changing them every time
    - this is because when the game starts it throws the player to the last level beaten
        - need to check if it does so even in main game
