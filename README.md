## TODO

- 1up effect when using a 1up from the item panel
- star item
- think about isClimbing and isWater properties
- add more characters in fonts
- world 3 conditional bridges
- flashing effect for whistle warps and castles
- object spawning when user-defined conditions are met
    - airship animation
    - anchor item
- figure out warps interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world
- check out interaction between encounters, bridges and water tiles
- implements encounters's movesWhen function
- check the selectStartPointSettings stuff
- join the yoshi gfx together
