## TODO

- flute and twister warp
- cloud item
- music box item
- hammer iem
- anchor item
- 1up effect when using a 1up from the item panel
- encounter movement types
- re-check settings (specifically hud settings, but others too)
- think about isClimbing and isWater properties
- add more characters in fonts

- object spawning when user-defined conditions are met
    - airship animation
- castle full-screen flash animation (low priority)
- figure out invisible warps and their interaction with area names
    - possibly something like this: check if we came to an area through inv. warp, if we did then simply do not play the animation
    - pipes would still play the animation, i think? they need to to implement the warp world
